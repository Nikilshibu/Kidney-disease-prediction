Kidney disease prediction is a healthcare analytics project aimed at developing a machine learning-based model to identify individuals at risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) or other kidney-related conditions. By leveraging patient health data such as blood test results, vital signs, medical history, and demographic information, the predictive system can provide early detection and assist in timely medical intervention.
